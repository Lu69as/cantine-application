This is a site made as a school project where you can see multiple products from the school cantine.

I have included a preview of how the site looks, but if you want all functionality, you have to follow these steps:
  1. Download files
  2. Extract zip file
  3. Download Visual studio if not already installed.
  4. inside the extracted folder, go to voting-site-master and open valgside.sln with visual stuio.
  5. Once fully loaded, double click / open Default.aspx in the solution explorer.
  8. Once opened, click the arrow + IIS Express button on the top of the program and enjoy the site.

  * To view products, just click them, not too hard is it?

  * The website is connected to my old shcools database, so please no hack.
